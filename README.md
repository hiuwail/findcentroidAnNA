# findcentroidAnNA
This is a R notebook file for finding and plotting the network closest to the centroid in PERMANOVA by Anatomical Network Analysis. 

Input files are binary matrices: AlligatorA.csv, AlligatorJ.csv, Caiman.csv, Crocodylus.csv, GavialisA.csv, 
Euparkeria.csv, Garjainia.csv, Paleorhinus.csv,Riojasuchus.csv, Erpetosuchus.csv 

The Euparkeria matrix is modified from Sookias et al. (2020) https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.200116. 
All the matrices in this repository are part of my PhD thesis (Lee, Hiu Wai (2023): Supporting data for Evolution and development of the pseudosuchian skull table sutures and their impact on the cranial topology. HKU Data Repository. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.25442/hku.22336429.v1).
